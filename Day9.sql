ðŸ“… Day 9 - SQL Aggregation & GROUP BY Deep Dive
âœ… Topics Covered:
GROUP BY clause

Aggregate functions:
SUM()
AVG()
MAX()
MIN()
COUNT()
Filtering groups with HAVING
Combining GROUP BY with JOIN

ðŸ§ª Practical Queries:
Total order amount by customer

SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
Average order amount per customer

SELECT customer_id, AVG(order_amount) AS avg_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
Number of orders per customer


SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
Maximum and Minimum order amount

SELECT MAX(order_amount) AS max_order, MIN(order_amount) AS min_order
FROM orders;
Customers who placed more than 1 order

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 1;
Total order amount by customer (with names - using JOIN)

SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name;
Average order amount by country

SELECT c.country, AVG(o.order_amount) AS avg_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country;
Countries with total spending > 2000

SELECT c.country, SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country
HAVING SUM(o.order_amount) > 2000;
ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings:
GROUP BY is used to organize data into groups for summary analysis.

HAVING filters groups after aggregation (unlike WHERE, which filters rows before grouping).

Aggregation + JOIN = Powerful insights from normalized data.
